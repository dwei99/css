            <h4>What is Git?</h4>
            <p>
            <h5>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a serues of
            snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot
            you build out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During
            this time you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous
            snapshots you took or merge those experiments into the your app.</h5>
            <p>
            <h4>What is GitHub?</h4>
            <h5> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
            It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using
            those code snapshots that you took during development.</h5>

              <p>
              <span style="color:blue">Git init</span> is the act of registering this
              current code base.

              <p>
              <span style="color:blue">Git add</span> is how we stage the intergration
              of our current code base into our current list of snapshots

              changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new snapshot of our

              <span style="color:blue">Git remote add</span> is used to set up a
              online repository where we can place all of our current code. This is

              <span style="color:blue">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github,
              an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers
              might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems,
              pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base
              with features they wanted to add
