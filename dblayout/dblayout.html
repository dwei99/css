              Databases are a collection of information, they are used for creating,
              manipulating, and deleting data. There are many different types of
              databases and they can be classified in a basic approach of relational
              database or a non-relational database. Relationships means a set of
              our data is related to another section of our data. Meanwhile in a
              non-relational database there is not a common related section of our
              data. Our databases are put into sections of data called schemas,
              inside each schema each data set is organized into tables, those tables
              contains columns and row to house that particular set of data.

              All databases are just a bin of storage. This storage is housed on
              your harddrive, often times large compaines will have floors upon
              floors of just database storage (think NSA styled). Our computer stores
              information on the harddrive, we are able to create new information,
              read information, update information and delete information.

              Since there could be potientally be a lot of information a database
              stores one problem we might run into is finding the data we are looking
              for. Imagine we had a room full of books and you were asked to find
              the Coding Dojo Algorithm Book. Well you might start picking up each
              book, checking the title and moving into the next until you found it.
              Thats very slow as most libraries discovered. Instead if we were to
              ID each item we can find it quickly.

              The amazing part about having a Database is that it is storage bin
              that holds onto all saved data. Well if only one user had access to
              that data its just like what we have built into our own computers,
              it wouldn't be useful to other users. However the joy of having a
              database is that it is a storage bin many users can interact with,
              creating, reading,updating and deleting information that all users
              would see.

              There are alot of large companies that specialize in the storing of
              information. As Big Data has erupted so too have the size and amount
              of companies on the market. That being said a lot of their software
              is free for most users, think of MySQL, which while being an incredible
              DB is completely free of cost and it used by a large company called
              Facebook.
